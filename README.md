We have three new Dynamic lists in Pardot. For future segmentation lists involving Prospects or Opportunities, please create them by duplicating US - 201612 - Prospects - All Open or US - 201612 - Opportunities and adding a new Dynamic Rule.

- US - 201612 - Prospects - All Open
- US - 201612 - Prospects - All Open - Previous 12 Months
